# Phase_1_Project
Project submission for phase-1 of the Software-Engineering program at FlatIron School.

Project requirments:

1. Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as 
   the communication format. ""FINISHED""

2. Your entire app must run on a single page. 
   There should be NO redirects. In other words, 
   your project will contain a single HTML file. ""FINISHED""

3. Your app needs to incorporate at least 3 separate event listeners 
   (DOMContentLoaded, click, change, submit, etc). ""FINISHED""

4. Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. 
   These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page. ""FINISHED""

5. Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) 
   by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.


NOTES-

1. This specific program is a single page application that takes new information and persists it in a local db.json file.

2. This program is an interactive page that mocks a scenario where dogs are playing BlackJack and keeps a roster of different dogs as players with statistics, as well 
as "deal out cards" represented by numbers between 1 and 21, if the player has more than 21 they "lose" and the game sends an alert to tell the user.

3. Updated pallette to be more traditional for a 'poker' setting.
